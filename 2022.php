		<h1>arrow's year in music: 2022</h1>
		<h2>the road changes</h2>

		<div id="blurb">

		<p>I got more into Pentagon's discography this year, after I had gotten so charmed by it by the end of the previous year. I also got really into Thai dramas this year, specifically <i>Bad Buddy</i>, so that was a huge influence on my on-repeat too.</p>
