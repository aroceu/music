		<p>This was also the year I turned 18. Though I didn't deliberately try to make and do more stuff as soon as I came of age, it kind of happened that way, anyway. Including compiling playlists like these. <small>(And if you see more NC-17 stuff around on my websites dated prior to this year...don't worry about it.)</small></p>
