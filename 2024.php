		<h1>arrow's year in music: 2024</h1>
		<h2>actually i won this year</h2>

		<div id="blurb"><p>The music of 2024 was what inspired me to create this subsection of my website in the first place, because every instance of mainstream American music this year has been straight up my alley. From Taylor Swift (she was my #1 streamed Spotify artist again. Because of "imgonnagetyouback" and "Guilty as Sin") to Kendrick Lamar and my long-awaited return to rap/hip-hop. Plus getting hit full force with the BLACKPINK hyperfixation.</p>

			<p>Even then, I would still consider <i>eternal sunshine</i> and <i>Cowboy Carter</i> my top two albums of this year. Oh, and <i>Warriors</i>. I started listening to <i>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</i> at the end of last year after a recommendation from my brother (namely, Red Wine Supernova which took me completely by storm) so I suppose that counts too. And I got into Olivia Rodrigo at the end of last year as well, so that leaked over in the beginning too.</p>

			<p>This is by far the largest amount of new same-year music I've ever had on a yearly playlist. It's also been one of the better years of my life; and having pop cultural moments to look forward to or get surprised by really enhanced that. I've had more fun this year than I've ever had before, and I don't know if that means anything but I'm still grateful for it all.</p>
